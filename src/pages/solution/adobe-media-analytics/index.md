If you update the Adobe Media Analytics for Audio and Video tag extension to v2.x in your tag property, you must make sure to update and use AEP SDK Media extension v2.0.0 and higher.

To configure the Media Analytics extension, complete the following steps:

### Collection API Server

Type the name of the media collection API server. This is the server where the downloaded media tracking data is sent. Important: You need to contact your Adobe account representative for this information.

### Channel

Type the channel name property.

### Player name

Type the name of the media player in use (for example, _AVPlayer_, _Native Player_, or _Custom Player_).

### Application version

Type the version of the media player application/SDK.

Legacy settings should not be configured for Media Extension v2.x and higher. Those settings are only for backwards compatibility.

If you are using Media Extension v1.x, then go to Legacy settings section 1. Enable the `Use Tracking Server` checkbox. 2. In **Tracking Server**, Type the name of the tracking server to which all media tracking data should be sent.

## Add Media extension to your app

### Include Media extension as an app dependency

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

This extension requires the [Adobe Analytics extension](../adobe-analytics/index.md). You must add the Analytics extension to your mobile property and make sure the extension is correctly configured.

Add MobileCore, Analytics and Media Analytics extensions as dependencies to your project.

### Initialize Adobe Experience Platform SDK with Media Extension

Next, initialize the SDK by registering all the solution extensions that have been added as dependencies to your project with Mobile Core. For detailed instructions, refer to the [initialization](/src/pages/home/getting-started/get-the-sdk/#2-add-initialization-code) section of the getting started page.

Using the `MobileCore.initialize` API to initialize the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK simplifies the process by automatically registering solution extensions and enabling lifecycle tracking.
