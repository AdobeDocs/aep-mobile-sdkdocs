# Decisioning Review & Simulate

This is a feature of Adobe Experience Platform Assurance which allows the users to review the content sent to devices for each request and simulate different experiences on the same devices in real time.

## Review Requests and Results

1. [Set up and connect](./assurance-for-decisioning.md) to an Assurance session.
2. Review the personalization requests and results by navigating to the Review and Simulate section.
   Make sure that at least one decision scope has been set up in the mobile application and an updateProposition request made to be able review them.

3. In the Requests tab you can see all personalization requests in the session. If you do not see any requests, call the updatePropositions API from the mobile application.

## Simulate Different Results

The result of each personalization request is customized for each user based on several deciding factors as configured. A unique experience is served for each user. Simulate allows the user to view a different experience than the one they are currently served.

You can simulate specific experiences served against a scope by following the steps below::

1. Move to the 'Simulate' tab in 'Review & Simulate' section.
   Make sure that at least one decision scope has been set up in the mobile application and an updateProposition request made to be able review them.

2. There are two ways to select activities that user wants to simulate:
   * Locations requested during the session - These are scopes/locations that were requested during the current session.
      * Select the scope you want to preview from the dropdown menu.
      * Upon selection, a list of all available experiences for the selected scope will be shown.

   * Locations not requested during session - Any activity, whether active or inactive, can also be simulated as long as application is listening to them.
      * Click on **Select specific target activities**
      * A list of available activities will be shown, you may select appropriate workspace and search through the list.
      * Select Activities that you want to simulate and click continue.
      * Upon Selection, a list of all available experiences for the selected scopes will be shown.

4. Simulate results can be updated on device via these two callbacks:
   1. [getPropositions](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/edge/adobe-journey-optimizer-decisioning/api-reference/#getpropositions) - This needs to be triggered by application to get updated results after simulation.
   2. [onPropositionsUpdate](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/edge/adobe-journey-optimizer-decisioning/api-reference/#onpropositionsupdate) - This provides a callback as soon as simulation is done and can be used to update data in real time.
