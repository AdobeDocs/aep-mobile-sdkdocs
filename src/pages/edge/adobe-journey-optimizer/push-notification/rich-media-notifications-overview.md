# Rich Media Push Notifications

Rich media push notifications allow you to deliver push notifications with text and multimedia content. This guide explains how to implement and use rich media push notifications in your iOS and Android applications.

## iOS

### Prerequisites

1. Configure your app for push notifications by following the [iOS push notification setup guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering-your-app-with-apns).
2. [Sync the received APNS push identifier](./ios/api-reference.md#sync-the-push-token) with Adobe Journey Optimizer.

### Rich Media Support

**Minimum supported OS version**: iOS 10.

The following aspect ratio recommendations help your images or videos display reliably across multiple devices. **These recommendations act only as a guideline**  - you should still test a notification prior to sending it.

1. **Images**
   * Maximum image file size: 10MB
   * Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF
   * Recommended aspect ratios: 4:3, 3:2, 2:1, or 1:1
2. **Video**
   * Maximum video file size: 50MB
   * Supported formats: MPEG, MPEG2 Video, MPEG4, AVI
   * Recommended aspect ratio: 16:9 (widescreen) and 9:16 (portrait)
3. **Audio**
   * Maximum audio file size: 5MB
   * Supported formats: AIFF, WAV, MP3, MPEG4 Audio

Unsupported rich media content will not be presented and the notification will be displayed with only the text content.

For more information, see [Apple's Notification Attachment documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationattachment#Supported-File-Types).

### Implementation Steps

See the documentation on [displaying iOS rich push notifications.](./ios/display-rich-notifications.md)

## Android

### Prerequisites

1. Android Messaging extension version 3.3.2 or newer.
2. Configure your app for push notifications following the documentation on [using the Messaging extension's implementation of the FirebaseMessagingService](./android/automatic-display-and-tracking.md#register-messaging-extensions-firebasemessagingservice)

### Rich Media Support

**Minimum supported OS version**: Android 14 / API 34

The maximum image size recommendations are provided to ensure that images are delivered in a timely manner regardless of network conditions. The aspect ratio recommendations help your images display reliably across multiple devices. **These recommendations act only as a guideline** - you should still test a notification prior to sending it.

1. **Images**
   * Recommended maximum image size: 5MB
   * Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF
   * Recommended aspect ratios: 4:3, 3:2, 2:1, or 16:9. A [1:1 square aspect ratio image](../assets/push-notification/square-image.png) can be used but the image will be [slightly stretched horizontally](../assets/push-notification/square-image-android-push.png) when displayed within a push notification as notification images are displayed in a standard 4:3 aspect ratio.

Unsupported rich media content will not be presented and the notification will be displayed with only the text content.

For more information, see Google's documentation [on native Android image support](https://developer.android.com/media/platform/supported-formats#image-formats) and the [Firebase documentation on sending push notifications with images](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/send-image).

### Implementation Steps

See the documentation on [using the Messaging extension's implementation of the FirebaseMessagingService.](./android/automatic-display-and-tracking.md#register-messaging-extensions-firebasemessagingservice)
