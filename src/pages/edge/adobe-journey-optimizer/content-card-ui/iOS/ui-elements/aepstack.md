# AEPStack

The AEPStack class is a fundamental layout container used to arrange multiple UI elements horizontally or vertically.

AEPStack conforms to `ObservableObject`, allowing it to be used reactively in SwiftUI views.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| spacing |	CGFloat |	The spacing between child views in the stack. | 8 |
| modifier |	AEPViewModifier |	A custom view modifier for additional styling. | N/A |

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

All properties are marked with [@Published](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published). Any changes will trigger updates to your UI.

# AEPVStack

## Customization

Below is an example of how to customize the AEPHStack and AEPVStack properties when working with a `SmallImageTemplate`:

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="1" languages="Swift" />

#### Swift

```swift
class MyCustomizer : ContentCardCustomizing {
    
    func customize(template: SmallImageTemplate) {        
        // customize stack properties
        template.rootHStack.spacing = 10
        template.textVStack.alignment = .leading
        template.textVStack.spacing = 20
        
        // Customize the button stack 
        template.buttonHStack.modifier = AEPViewModifier(ButtonHStackModifier())        
    }
    
    struct ButtonStackModifier: ViewModifier {
        func body(content: Content) -> some View {
            content
                .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .trailing)
        }
    }
}
```
