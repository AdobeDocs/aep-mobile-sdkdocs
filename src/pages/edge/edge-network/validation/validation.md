# Validation

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network extension is integrated with Adobe Experience Platform Assurance mobile extension to allow for request-response events inspection and provides rich verbose logging that can be used when verifying your mobile implementation.

## SDK Logging

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs allow for detailed debugging in debug or test environments when using Verbose or Debug Log level. To enable this and see the log messages in your IDE set the verbose/trace mode for [MobileCore logging](../../home/getting-started/enable-debug-logging.md#debug-logging).

## Validate with Assurance

While the log messages can be quite helpful for an application developer, inspecting the events in the [Assurance UI](https://experience.adobe.com/assurance/) is even easier. In just a few steps, you can view the timestamp ordered list of all the events generated by the Edge Network mobile extension, along with the confirmation that the request was successfully processed by the Edge Network and the enabled server-side solutions.

### Get started with Assurance

1. Start by following the instructions for [using Assurance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/assurance/user-access.html).
2. [Install and register the Assurance extension](../../home/base/assurance/index.md) in your mobile app.
3. Follow the same document for [connecting to an Assurance session](../../home/base/assurance/index.md#connect-to-an-assurance-session).

### Use the Event Transactions view

Inspect and validate the Experience events using the Event Transactions view in Assurance:

1. In the Assurance UI, from the left navigation menu, select **Event Transactions**. If you don't see this option, select **Configure** in the bottom left of the window, add the **Event Transactions**, and select **Save**.
2. Follow the link to get familiar with the debugging options in the [Event Transactions view](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/assurance/view/event-transactions.html).
