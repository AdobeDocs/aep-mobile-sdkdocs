## Check if your version is up to date

Inside this view, a table displays both the latest version of each Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK, as well as the current version you have installed, if applicable. When a version is in sync with the latest version, the installed version will display a green badge. Otherwise, the badge will be displayed in red.

## Export versions

On the top right of the view, you can select **Export Versions** which gives you a JSON payload with all the extensions information, as well as the platform used by the client. You may choose to export this data to a JSON file, or copy it to your clipboard.
