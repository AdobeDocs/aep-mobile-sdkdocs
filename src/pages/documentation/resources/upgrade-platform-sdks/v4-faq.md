# Frequently asked questions - Adobe Mobile Library (v4) end-of-support

## Why is the support for Adobe Mobile Library (v4) ending?

The version 4 SDKs were first released in September 2013 to support mobile app implementations for Adobe Analytics (including Mobile Services), Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Target, and Adobe Campaign. These performant, well-tested SDKs provided rich functionality and are used in well over 18,000 apps across app stores.

Spurred by customer feedback for more control, performance, and functionality over the years; and to support future product enhancements, we released the re-architected [Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs](../../../index.md) in September 2018. The new Experience Platform Mobile SDKs replaces the version 4 SDKs and provide support for new features such as flexible configuration through the Data Collection UI, modular Adobe and partner extensions.

Solutions such as [Places Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/places/using/home.html) and [Adobe Experience Platform Assurance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/assurance/home.html) are exclusively available on Experience Platform Mobile SDKs.

## Where do I learn more about upgrading/migrating to the Experience Platform Mobile SDKs?

To upgrade to the Experience Platform SDKs, see [Upgrade to the Experience Platform SDKs](..).

## Will Mobile Services functionality still work?

Yes! This end-of-support statement does not affect your use of Mobile Services in any way. You may continue to use features such as marketing links, push notifications, and in-app messaging by leveraging the Adobe Analytics - Mobile Services extension for the Experience Platform Mobile SDKs. Note that you will need to migrate from version 4 SDKs to Adobe Experience Platform SDKs after August 2021.

## Can I still download and use the version 4 SDKs?

You can continue to use the version 4 SDKs after the end-of-support dates. However, as mentioned in the [end-of-support considerations section](../index.md#end-of-support-considerations), no support will be provided.
