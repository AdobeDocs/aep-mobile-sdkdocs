#### Objective-C

Start Lifecycle data collection by calling `lifecycleStart:` from within the callback of the `ACPCore::start:` method in your app's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate method.

If your iOS application supports background capabilities, you `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method may be called when iOS launches your app in the background. If you do not want background launches to count towards your lifecycle metrics, then `lifecycleStart:` should only be called when the application state is not equal to `UIApplicationStateBackground`.

```objectivec
- (BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // register the lifecycle extension
    [ACPLifecycle registerExtension];

    const UIApplicationState appState = application.applicationState;
    [ACPCore start:^{
        // only start lifecycle if the application is not in the background
        if (appState != UIApplicationStateBackground) {
            [ACPCore lifecycleStart:nil];
        }
    }];
}
```

When launched, if your app is resuming from a backgrounded state, iOS may call your `applicationWillEnterForeground:` delegate method. You also need to call `lifecycleStart:`, but this time you do not need all of the supporting code that you used in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`:

```objectivec
- (void) applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application {
    [ACPCore lifecycleStart:nil];
}
```

When the app enters the background, pause Lifecycle data collection from your app's `applicationDidEnterBackground:` delegate method:

```objectivec
 - (void) applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application {
    [ACPCore lifecyclePause];
 }
```
