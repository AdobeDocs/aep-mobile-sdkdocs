The `signalWithData` API sends Audience Manager a signal with traits and returns the matching segments for the visitor in a closure.

Audience Manager sends the AAM UUID in response in initial signal call. The AAM UUID is persisted in `NSUserDefaults` and is sent by the SDK in all subsequent signal requests. If available, the Experience Cloud ID (MID) is also sent in each signal request with the DPID and the DPUUID. The visitor profile that Audience Manager returns is saved in `NSUserDefaults` and is updated with every signal call.

#### Swift

**Syntax**

```swift
static func signalWithData(data: [String: String], completion: @escaping ([String: String]?, Error?) -> Void)
```

* `data` is the traits data for the current visitor.
* `callback` is the void method that is invoked with the visitor's profile as a parameter.

**Example**

```swift
Audience.signalWithData(data: ["trait": "trait value"]) { (traits, error) in
  if error != nil {
     // handle the error here
     } else {
     // handle the returned visitorProfile here
     }
}
```

#### Objective-C

**Example**

```objc
NSDictionary *traits = @{@"key1":@"value1",@"key2":@"value2"};
[AEPMobileAudience signalWithData:traits completion:^(NSDictionary<NSString *,NSString *> * _Nullable visitorProfile, NSError* _Nullable error) {
  if (error) {
     // handle the error here
     } else {
     // handle the returned visitorProfile dictionary here
     }
}];
```
