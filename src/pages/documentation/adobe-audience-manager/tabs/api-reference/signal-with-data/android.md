The `signalWithData` API sends Audience Manager a signal with traits and returns the matching segments for the visitor in a callback.

Audience Manager sends the AAM UUID in response in initial signal call. The AAM UUID is persisted in `SharedPreferences` and is sent by the SDK in all subsequent signal requests. If available, the ECID is also sent in each signal request with the DPID and the DPUUID. The visitor profile that Audience Manager returns is saved in `SharedPreferences` and is updated with every signal call.

When an `AdobeCallbackWithError` is provided, an `AdobeError` can be returned in the eventuality of an unexpected error or if the default timeout (5000ms) is met before the callback is returned with the visitor profile.

#### Java

**Syntax**

```java
public static void signalWithData(final Map<String, String> data, final AdobeCallback<Map<String, String>> callback)
```

* `data` is the traits data for the current visitor.
* `callback` is the void method that is invoked with the visitor's profile as a parameter.

**Example**

```java
AdobeCallback<Map<String, String>> visitorProfileCallback = new AdobeCallback<Map<String, String>>() {
    @Override
    public void call(final Map<String, String> visitorProfile) {
        // handle the returned visitorProfile here
    }
};
â€‹
Map<String, String> traits = new HashMap<String, String>();
traits.put("trait", "xyz");
Audience.signalWithData(traits, visitorProfileCallback);
```
