## Unable to open app with QR code or generated link

If scanning the QR code or opening the deep link in Adobe Experience Platform Assurance does not open your app, deep linking may not be correctly configured in your mobile application.

Please follow OS developer documentation to learn more on setting up deep linking.

## PIN screen does not appear

When the generated link or QR code from Adobe Experience Platform Assurance is opened on device, it should launch your app and show a PIN screen to establish a Assurance session (as shown below). If this screen does not appear, ensure the following:

### Copy link or open QR code from Adobe Experience Platform Assurance

The PIN screen may not show if the link or QR code is incorrect (or doesn't contain the query parameter `adb_validation_sessionid`). You may detect this error by seeing console logs with the following strings:

<TabsBlock orientation="horizontal" slots="heading, content" repeat="2"/>

Android

<Tabs query="platform=android&task=copy-link"/>

iOS

<Tabs query="platform=ios&task=copy-link"/>

This issue may be resolved by scanning the right QR code or correctly copying the link generated in Assurance.

## Connection error

After you enter the PIN, if you see the following Connection Error:

![Connection error](./assets/common-issues/assurance-connection-error.png)

You may resolve it by double-checking the PIN is entered correctly from the session associated link or QR code:

Or ensuring internet connectivity on the device/simulator.

## Invalid Mobile SDK configuration

If you see an Invalid Mobile SDK Configuration error (see screenshot below), verify the following:

1. Mobile Core is [configured](../mobile-core/configuration/api-reference.md)
2. Configuration in the Data Collection UI is [published](../getting-started/create-a-mobile-property.md#publish-the-configuration)
3. Ensure the device/simulator has internet connectivity
