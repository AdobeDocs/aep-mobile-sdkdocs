<InlineAlert variant="warning" slots="text"/>

This event reference document is applicable to ACPTarget 2.x.

## Events handled

The following events are handled by the Target extension:

### Target content request

This event is created when an API is called to send a Target request or Target prefetch request for the associated mbox location.

The event is generated by the API in the following situations:

* When a new Target request needs to be sent (`loadRequests` or `retrieveLocationContent`)
* When a Target prefetch is initiated (`prefetchContent`)
* When the Target preview restart deeplink is set (`setPreviewRestartDeepLink`)
* When a click notification needs to be sent to Target (`locationClicked`)
* When a display notification needs to be sent to Target (`locationsDisplayed`)

#### Data payload definition

Here are the key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Required** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `restartdeeplink` | String | No | Populated when the `setPreviewRestartDeepLink` API is called. |
| `profileparams` | StringMap | No | Populated when the `prefetchContent`/ `loadRequests` API is called. |
| `islocationclicked` | Boolean | No | Populated when `locationClicked` API is invoked. |
| `islocationdisplayed` | Boolean | No | Populated when `locationsDisplayed` API is invoked. |

The `locationClicked` API parameters are also sent in the event, as described below:

```json
{
    "islocationclicked": <Boolean>,
    "mboxname": <String>,
    "mboxparameters": <StringMap>,
    "productparameters": <StringMap>,
    "orderparameters": <VariantMap>,
    "profileparams": <StringMap>
}
```

| Key | Value Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| prefetch | VariantVector | No | Populated when the  `prefetchContent` API is called. |

The `prefetch` key contains a list of objects, each with the following content:

```json
{
    "mboxname": <String>,
    "mboxparameters": <VariantMap>,
    "profileparams": <VariantMap>,
    "productparameters": <VariantMap>,
    "orderparameters": <VariantMap>
}
```

| Key | Value Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `request` | `VariantVector` | No | Populated when `loadRequests` is called. |

The `request` key contains a list of Target requests, each with the following content:

```json
{
    {
        "mboxname": <String>,
        "mboxparameters": <VariantMap>,
        "profileparams": <VariantMap>,
        "productparameters": <VariantMap>,
        "orderparameters": <VariantMap>
    }
    "defaultcontent": <String>,
    "responsepairid": <String>
}
```

### Target identity request

This event is a request to retrieve Target identities, such as third-party IDs and TNT IDs, or to set the third-party ID.

This event will be generated by the API that is:

* Requesting a Target Identity (`getThirdPartyId`, `getTntId`).
* Setting the third-party ID (`setThirdPartyId`).

#### Data payload definition

Here are the key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Required** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `thirdpartyid` | String | No | Populated when the `setThirdPartyId` API is called. |

### Target reset request

This event is created by customers who use the API to reset the Target parameters.

This event is generated by the API in the following scenarios:

* From the customers to clear Target parameters (`resetExperience`).
* To clear the prefetch cache (`clearPrefetchCache`).

#### Data payload definition

Here are key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Required** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `resetexperience` | Boolean | No | Present in the event generated by the `resetExperience` API. |
| `clearcache` | Boolean | No | Present in the event generated by the `clearPrefetchCache` API. |

### Configuration response content

The data property in the Configuration response content event is used by each extension to modify its current settings. Each extension is responsible to read out the part of the data property for which it is concerned.

The Target extension will read the following keys from the configuration event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Required** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `target.clientCode` | String | Yes | The Target Client Code that is obtained during provisioning with the Target solution. |
| `target.environmentId` | Integer | No | The Target Environment ID. |
| `target.timeout` | Integer | No | This value is used for Target request connection timeouts (in seconds). If the value is not set, a default value of 5 seconds is used. |
| `global.privacy` | String | No | This contains the mobile privacy status settings. |
| `target.previewEnabled` | Boolean | No | Boolean value to determine whether Target preview should be enabled. If not set, then the preview is enabled by default. |

## Events dispatched

The following events are dispatched by the Target extension:

### Target Content response

This event is created when the Target server response is received, and the prefetch or load request operation is completed. Network responses are generated from the Target server for prefetch or load request calls.

This event is dispatched in the following scenarios:

* In response to an API prefetch content request. This event contains a `prefetchresult` key of type _boolean_, which signals the success or failure of the prefetch request.
* In response to an API batch load requests, where one event is dispatched per request.

  This event contains a `content` key of type _string_ that contains mbox content.

#### Data payload definition

Here are the key-value pairs in this event:

| **Key** | **Value Type** | **Required** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `content` | String | No | Response content is returned by the Target server for a load request with valid locations. |
| `prefetchresult` | Boolean | No | Prefetch status returned after a Target prefetch request. |
| `prefetcherror` | String | No | Prefetch response error if any, otherwise null |

### Target Identity response

This event delivers the Target identities to the following:

* The original requester.
* To any extension that might be listening for updates.

This event is generated by the Target extension as a response to the Target Identity Request event.

| `thirdpartyid` | String | No | The current Third Party ID that is set from the API. |

### Target preview response

This event is generated when the marketer enters or exits Target preview mode. It can be used to trigger any custom workflows or API calls based on the preview flag by the following:

* The original requester.
* To any extension that might be listening for updates.
