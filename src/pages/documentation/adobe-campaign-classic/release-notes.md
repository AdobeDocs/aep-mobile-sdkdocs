## January 31, 2023

### Android Campaign Classic 2.0.0

* Major version update for [Adobe Campaign Classic workflows](./index.md) for Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs on Android compatible with Mobile Core 2.0.0. This library is now available as an [open source project on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-campaignclassic-android).

Please note that the `registerDevice` API, similar to iOS, no longer provides a callback method for registration status since a `false` value cannot be accurately used as a signal to retry requests.
