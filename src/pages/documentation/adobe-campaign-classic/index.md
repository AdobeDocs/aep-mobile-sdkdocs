<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

You can retrieve your Campaign Classic registration or tracking endpoint URLs in the Campaign Classic interface under the **Tools > Advanced > Deployment wizard** menu. The endpoint for push notifications is usually the same as the URL that is used for web forms and surveys.

#### Registration endpoints

Type the registration endpoint URL(s) for your Campaign Classic instances. You can specify up to three unique endpoints for your development, staging, and production environments.

<InlineAlert variant="warning" slots="text"/>

For this extension, the registration endpoint URLs should be entered **without** a prefixing `https://.`

#### Tracking endpoints

Type the tracking endpoint URL(s) for your Campaign Classic instances. Like the registration URLs, you can specify up to three unique endpoints for your development, staging, and production environments.

For this extension, the tracking endpoint URLs should be entered **without** a prefixing `https://.`

#### Integration key (iOS)

You can specify up to three unique iOS integration keys for your development, staging, and production environments. iOS integration keys are generated after creating a service that contains iOS applications using the [Campaign Classic client console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/installing-campaign-classic/connect-to-campaign/installing-the-client-console.html). For more information on where to find the integration key, see the tutorial on [configuring the mobile application in Adobe Campaign](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-push-notifications/configure-the-mobile-app/configuring-the-mobile-application.html).

#### Integration key (Android)

You can specify up to three unique Android integration keys for your development, staging, and production environments. Android integration keys are generated after creating a service that contains Android applications using the [Campaign Classic client console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/installing-campaign-classic/connect-to-campaign/installing-the-client-console.html). For more information on where to find the integration key, see the tutorial on [configuring the mobile application in Adobe Campaign](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-push-notifications/configure-the-mobile-app/configuring-the-mobile-application-android.html).

#### Request timeout

The request timeout is the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the registration or tracking endpoint before timing out. The SDK default timeout value is 30 seconds.
