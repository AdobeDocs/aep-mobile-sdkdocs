On Android, the SDK handles push tracking to analytics without any additional set up. If the application has implemented the `FirebaseMessaginService` class and will handle the push notifications when the application is in foreground, read the push data from the received Intent and add it to the intent extras of the Activity to be launched. An example can be found in [the Mobile Services implement push messaging tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/mobile-services_en/android/messaging-android/push-messaging/t-mob-impl-push-deeplinking-android-4x.html?lang=en).
