# Manual Lifecycle implementation

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

In Adobe Mobile Library (v4) iOS SDK, this implementation was completed automatically.<br/>When upgrading to the Experience Platform SDK, you must add code to continue collecting Lifecycle metrics.

Follow the [Lifecycle implementation guide](/src/pages/home/base/mobile-core/lifecycle/index.md) which includes the following steps:
* [Add Lifecycle to your app](/src/pages/home/base/mobile-core/lifecycle/index.md#add-lifecycle-to-your-app)
* [Register Lifecycle with Mobile Core](/src/pages/home/base/mobile-core/lifecycle/index.md#register-lifecycle-with-mobile-core)
* [Manually add Lifecycle start and pause calls to your application](/src/pages/home/base/mobile-core/lifecycle/index.md#add-lifecycle-start-and-pause-calls)
