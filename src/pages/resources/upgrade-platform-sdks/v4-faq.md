# Frequently asked questions - Adobe Mobile Library (v4) end-of-support

## Why is the support for Adobe Mobile Library (v4) ending?

The version 4 SDKs were first released in September 2013 to support mobile app implementations for Adobe Analytics (including Mobile Services), Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Target, and Adobe Campaign. These performant, well-tested SDKs provided rich functionality and are used in well over 18,000 apps across app stores.

Spurred by customer feedback for more control, performance, and functionality over the years; and to support future product enhancements, we released the re-architected Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs in September 2018. The new Experience Platform Mobile SDKs replaces the version 4 SDKs and provide support for new features such as flexible configuration through the Data Collection UI, modular Adobe and partner extensions.

Solutions such as [Places Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/places/using/home.html) and [Adobe Experience Platform Assurance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/assurance/home.html) are exclusively available on Experience Platform Mobile SDKs.

## Where do I learn more about upgrading/migrating to the Experience Platform Mobile SDKs?
