Good to go for iOS 17 and Android 14

The latest versions of the Adobe Experience Platform SDK for Android and iOS (Swift and Objective-C) are tested for compatibility with the release versions of Google Android 14 and Apple iOS 17. See [Current SDK Versions](./current-sdk-versions.md) to find our latest SDK versions, or [release notes](./release-notes/index.md) for information on changes and updates.

At WWDC23, Apple announced several new privacy features impacting applications and SDKs. The announcement included an upcoming requirement for developers to provide the reason for using certain APIs — including APIs currently used by the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK — in the privacy manifest. Apple plans to start enforcing this requirement in the spring of 2024. Adobe is currently working with Apple to better understand the impact of this change. We anticipate that we will be able to provide further information regarding how this change will impact iOS applications that use the Experience Platform Mobile SDK in the coming months.

## Bring the Adobe Experience Cloud to your apps

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK helps power Adobe's Experience Cloud solutions and services in your mobile apps.

The SDK is comprised of the Mobile Core and a series of modular Adobe Experience Cloud solutions or third-party vendor extensions that depend on the Mobile Core. Extensions interact with the Mobile Core to provide features specific to the solution or service they represent.

Experience Platform Mobile SDKs are available for Android, iOS, and a [variety](#supported-platforms) of cross-platform development frameworks. SDKs configuration is managed through the Data Collection UI for flexible configuration and extensible, rules-based integrations.
