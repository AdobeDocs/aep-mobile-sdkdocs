# Lifecycle

Sessions contain information about the app's current lifecycle, such as the device information, the application install or upgrade information, the session start and pause times, the number of application launches, and additional context data that is provided by the developer through the `lifecycleStart` API. Session data is persisted, so it is available across application launches.

## Add the Lifecycle extension to your app

### Include Lifecycle extension as an app dependency

Add MobileCore and Lifecycle extensions as dependencies to your project.

<Tabs query="platform=android-groovy&task=add"/>

CocoaPods<br/>(iOS)

### Initialize Adobe Experience Platform SDK with Lifecycle Extension

Next, initialize the SDK by registering all the solution extensions that have been added as dependencies to your project with Mobile Core. For detailed instructions, refer to the [initialization](/src/pages/home/getting-started/get-the-sdk/#2-add-initialization-code) section of the getting started page.

Using the `MobileCore.initialize` API to initialize the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK simplifies the process by automatically registering solution extensions and enabling lifecycle tracking.

<InitializeSDK query="componentClass=TabsBlock"/>

## Add Lifecycle start and pause calls

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

Lifecycle tracking is enabled by default when the `MobileCore.initialize` API is used and Lifecycle extension is included as an app dependency. The following instructions only apply if [lifecycleAutomaticTrackingEnabled](/src/pages/home/base/mobile-core/api-reference/#initoptions) is false or when using [manual extension registration](/src/pages/home/getting-started/get-the-sdk/#b-manual-extension-registration-using-mobilecoreregisterextensions-api) to register Lifecycle extension.

You can start collecting Lifecycle information at any time in your app, but you should start as soon as your app enters the foreground. This allows Lifecycle metrics to be correctly attributed to all of your users' activities for their current session.

You should pause Lifecycle collection when the user stops using your app. The best time to do this is usually when your app has entered the background.

### Lifecycle on iOS

#### Start Lifecycle data collection on launch

Start Lifecycle data collection by calling `lifecycleStart(_:)` from within the callback of the `MobileCore.registerExtensions(_:)` method in your app's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` delegate method.

If your iOS application supports background capabilities, your `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method might be called when iOS launches your app in the background. If you do not want background launches to count towards your lifecycle metrics, then `lifecycleStart(_:)` should only be called when the application state is not equal to `UIApplicationStateBackground`.

Swift

<Tabs query="platform=ios-swift&task=start-lifecycle-didfinishlaunch"/>

Objective-C

<Tabs query="platform=ios-objc&task=start-lifecycle-didfinishlaunch"/>

#### Start and Pause Lifecycle data collection from iOS lifecycle delegate

When your app is resuming from the background state, call `lifecycleStart(_:)` from the appropriate delegate object's "will enter foreground" method. When your app enters the background state, call `lifecyclePause()` from the appropriate delegate object's "did enter background" method.

* For a scene-based UI, call the Lifecycle APIs from the _UISceneDelegate_'s `sceneWillEnterForeground(_:)` and `sceneDidEnterBackground(_:)` methods.

* For all other apps, call the Lifecycle APIs from the _UIApplicationDelegate_'s `applicationWillEnterForeground(_:)` and `applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)` methods.

* If your application supports both a scene delegate and an app delegate, implement the Lifecycle APIs in both delegate objects.

For more information on handling foreground and background states in applications with Scenes, refer to Apple's documentation on preparing your UI to run in the [foreground](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_foreground) and [background](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background)

#### Start and Pause Lifecycle data collection in SwiftUI

If your pure SwiftUI application does not use an app delegate or scene delegate, you may still use the Lifecycle extension by listening for `scenePhase` changes.

1. Register the Lifecycle extension and configure the Mobile SDK from the `App` class's `init()` function.

2. Set the `@Environment` property wrapper to observe the `scenePhase` variable to read the application's current phase.

3. Use the `scenePhase` property in conjunction with `.onChange(of:)` to trigger the Lifecycle APIs when the phase changes between `.active` and `.background`.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AEPCore
import AEPLifecycle

@main
struct TestSwiftUIApp: App {

    @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase

    init() {
        MobileCore.registerExtensions([Lifecycle.self]) {
            // Post registration tasks, such as configureWith(appId:)
        }
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }.onChange(of: scenePhase) { phase in
            switch phase {
                case .active:
                    MobileCore.lifecycleStart(additionalContextData: nil)
                case .background:
                    MobileCore.lifecyclePause()
                case .inactive:
                    print("Inactive scene phase")
                @unknown default:
                    print("unknown scene phase has been added to scenePhase enum")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Include additional context data

To include additional data with lifecycle tracking calls, pass an additional parameter to `lifecycleStart(additionalContextData:)` that contains context data:

<TabsBlock orientation="horizontal" slots="heading, content" repeat="2"/>

Swift

<Tabs query="platform=ios-swift&task=context-data"/>

Objective-C

<Tabs query="platform=ios-objc&task=context-data"/>

### Lifecycle on Android

#### Start and Pause Lifecycle data collection from Android Activity

To ensure accurate session and crash reporting, the Lifecycle APIs must be implemented in every Activity of the Android Application. Do not start or stop Lifecycle in a Fragment.

<TabsBlock orientation="horizontal" slots="heading, content" repeat="2"/>

Kotlin

<Tabs query="platform=android-kotlin&task=activity-start-pause"/>

Java

<Tabs query="platform=android-java&task=activity-start-pause"/>

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

Calling `setApplication(Application)` is only necessary on activities that are entry points for your application. However, setting the application on each Activity has no negative impact and ensures that the SDK always has the necessary reference to your application. You should call `setApplication(Application)` in each of your activities.

#### Implementing global lifecycle callbacks

Starting with API Level 14, Android allows global lifecycle callbacks for activities. For more information, please read the [Android developer guide](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application#registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(android.app.Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks)).

You can use these callbacks to ensure that all of your activities correctly call the Lifecycle APIs without needing to update each individual Activity class. Add code to register an instance of [ActivityLifecycleCallbacks](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks) in your Application class, just before [registering your extensions](#register-lifecycle-with-mobile-core) with MobileCore.

<TabsBlock orientation="horizontal" slots="heading, content" repeat="2"/>

Kotlin

<Tabs query="platform=android-kotlin&task=global-lifecycle"/>

Java

<Tabs query="platform=android-java&task=global-lifecycle"/>

#### Include additional context data

To include additional data with lifecycle tracking calls, pass an additional parameter to `lifecycleStart(Map)` that contains context data:

<TabsBlock orientation="horizontal" slots="heading, content" repeat="2"/>

Kotlin

<Tabs query="platform=android-kotlin&task=context-data"/>

Java

<Tabs query="platform=android-java&task=context-data"/>

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

You only need to add this code in your main Activity and any other Activity in which your app may be launched.
